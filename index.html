                    Good morning/afternoon/night! First off, I wanted to give a couple updates about what'll be going on with Soundcheck this year:
                    I'll keep doing the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soundcheck_wl/" target="_blank">weekly posts</a> for upcoming shows, as well as the zine (finishing up some stuff but there's still a bit of time
                    if you'd like to submit something!). I'd also really like to put together an archive section on here of show photos from the last
                    couple years which will probably be a real headache but we'll see. ALSO there'll be a Soundcheck show on Wiley Radio for band
                    interviews and acoustic sessions so stay tuned for that! On another note, there's still something of a venue shortage, though
                    there's a couple new spots that are gearing up to host so we should see more spots in the next couple of weeks. Fingers crossed
                    WLPD doesn't get too worked up over it. There's also a handful of new bands popping up, so overall things are really shaping up
                    <br><br>
                    See ya in a backyard or basement soon

                <h2><p style="font-family:'Swis721 BdOul BT'">It Was a Good Run</p></h2>
                <h5><p style="font-family: Monaco,monospace">R.I.P. The Nest 2022-2025, Apr 1, 2025<p></h5>
                <p style="font-family: Monaco,monospace">
                    As you've probably heard by now, a couple week ago our most frequently hosting local venue, The Nest, got a message from their landlord telling them to cease all shows immediately or face legal action.
                    Obviously this means all shows the cancelled for the foreseeable future (probably indefinitely), which is a huge blow to the local music scene here in West Lafayette. The Nest served as a place for us
                    to start new bands and meet new friends, and if you are reading this, I'm sure you've spent more than a few weekends there.
                    While losing this venue will mean a short term drop in local shows, it doesn't mean the end of what we've got going here; if you live in a house with a basement, backyard, living room, or some other
                    space big enough for a drum kit, some amps, and some people (or you know someone who does) consider hosting even one show. If you need help with how to organize, feel free to reach out and we'll help out.
                    The Nest got hit partially due to how often they had shows, but with enough alternatives to break up the responsibility, the scene will be able to thrive beyond just one shut down.
                    In the meantime, there are still a couple places that we can go to see our music, so thanks to those venues, and thanks to The Nest for the good times.

                    Hope to see you at a show soon.
